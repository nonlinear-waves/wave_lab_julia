function semicirc(circpnts, imagpnts, ksteps, R, spread, zerodist, lambda_steps = 0)
    # Returns a quarter of a semicircle
    #
    # Input "circpnts" is the number of points on the circle part, "imagpnts"
    # is the number of points on the imaginary axis, "ksteps" is the number of
    # kato steps taken between contour points, "R" is the
    # radius of the semicircle, "spread" is a constant that spreads the points
    # on the imaginary axis so that they are more dense near the origin, and
    # "zerodist" is how close along the imaginary axis the contour comes to the
    # origin. If not specified, "lambda_points" defaults to zero. If specified,
    # "lambda_points" is the number of contour points between Kato steps. That
    # is, the analytic basis is not computed on the additional lambda_steps
    # points unless achieving relative error tolerances of the Evans function ouput
    # requires it. If that is the case, the analytic Kato basis is only
    # computed on the region where additional Evans function evaluations are
    # needed.
