function winding_number(w)

    # Returns the winding number of a contour w
    #
    # Input "w" should be a closed contour not passing through zero.
    #
    # If f is analytic and nonzero at each point of a simple closed positively
    # oriented contour C and is meromorphic inside C, then
    # winding_number(w)=N0-Np where w=f'(C)./f(C) and N0 and Np are respectively
    # the number of zeros and poles of f inscide C (multiplicity included).
    #
    # The change in the argument between any two points of w should be less than
    # Pi for winding_number(w) to be accurate. 

    # Computes the winding number of the contour
